# technical-test-cypress
## Environment setup
This technical test was developed with Cypress and Cucumber as a BDD framework. In order to be able to execute the project these are the main requirements and dependencies:

* Node.js 18.x or Node.js 20.x and above (mine is 18.16.0)
* For further prerquisites on Linux based systems, please refer to Cypress System requirements (https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements)

## Cloning and Executing the project
Once the node dependency is installed and the repo is cloned, proceed with the following steps:
* Inside the root path of the project execute the following commands:
    * npm install
    * ./node_modules/.bin/cypress install
* To execute the tests in headless mode:
    * ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run --browser chrome
* To execute the tests from the Cypress GUI 
    * npx cypress open (if this command fails, run  npm install cypress --save-dev)
    * Once the app opens, select E2E Testing
    * Select the browser in which the tests will run
    * Click on "WordCounter.feature"

After executing the tests either headless or by GUI, a report file will be generated in the following path: "cypress/cucumber-json/". To generate an HTML report based on the .json report generated by Cucumber, execute the following command on the root path of the project:

* node cucumber-html-report.js 

This will generate an HTML report on the following path: "reports/cucumber-report.html/"
